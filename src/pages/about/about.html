   <h2>About App</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h4>Garret Tonra - G00341908@gmit.ie</h4>
<h4>Final Year project Software Development GMIT</h4>
<br>
<br>I have decided to create a Ionic 2 mobile/Web Application
<br>The project was guided by the following excerpt from the project instructions:
<br>You are required to develop a application written in the preferred programming language of your Choice.
<br>You must devise an idea for a application.
<br>Write the software. Write documentation explaining how the application works.
<br>Write a short user guide for it.
<br>
<h2>The Application I Chose was a Workout App</h2>
<br>The Software is written using the following : 
<br>ionic 2 framework, Angular 2 - Typescript, Nodejs & served on MLab Cloud Database.
<br>I shall be implementing this on Android/IOS/and Web platforms
<br>This App will allow a user to do the following features to a Workout as follows
<br>1.Add a workout.
<br>2.Delete a workout.
<br>3.Add a new Exercise to the List.
<br>4.View workout details.
